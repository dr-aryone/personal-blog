<h1> Personal Blog </h1>

This application was created by myself in order to practice using Node.JS, Express, and MongoDB. 

<h3> What I learned </h3>

Whilst creating this app I learned several things and also developed my skills further in areas I was new to. Some of those skills I developed include: 

<ul>

<li>Using Passport - I used the node module Passport for this application in order to get user logins</li>
<li>Using MongoDB - I used MongoDB to store my user accounts as well as my blog articles</li>
<li>CRUD Operations - I learned how to build in features such as creating a blog from the dashboard and having it generate on the page</li>
<li>SASS - I style the application using SASS which then compiled into regular CSS</li>
<li>CSS Grid - I used the CSS grid layout to style the blog page</li>
